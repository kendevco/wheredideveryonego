Dynamic Version - only way to update the text files is to push a revision. Which is fine. We won't need to update the book text - at least for this. We just need an elegant viewer for the book. Ideally it would also read aloud the text - we'll worry about that later. 

I would like you to add mcp server support such that language model can exercise crud on the payload globals and collections. This way, for example we could later add a connection to Chat GPT or our LEO Site AI. 

Is there a way to add this MCP like functionality without changing any of the collections ? Meaning code only approach? 

The MCP would accept a request securely enough and interpret it and execute the appropriate crud. This would enable your instance or another mcp using chat agent to manage this site for my brother.
