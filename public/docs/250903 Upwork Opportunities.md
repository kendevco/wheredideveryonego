I'm looking for a full stack developer to work directly with me (founder) on developing, supporting and maintaining an event planning web app. The role would be part-time, with some weeks of higher load if we're pushing a new feature and quiet if we're just maintaining, on an ongoing basis. Work is estimated to be 2-15hrs per week. You can be anywhere with a reliable internet connection, and the work can be done almost fully async (we work 90% on Slack and Linear), so the job suits someone who values flexibility. The other team members are also part-time and travel almost constantly, so time zone is irrelevant. You must \- be fluent in English, both spoken and written \- be an experienced developer, who can work solo to deliver quality results \- be responsible for all technical aspects of the app, including things like security, monitoring for impending obsolescence etc \- be experienced enough to suggest better ways of doing things, ask clarifying questions about new feature logic and so \- as shown by the expected hours, this shouldn't be your main source of income Since it is an event planning app real life experience / empathy for the work of professional event planners (which is what we are) would helps a lot. I am also a US-based former startup founder and investor, so working with me can also serve as an introduction to that world if you're interested but lack exposure. To apply please state what interests you about the job, what your solo/lead technical experience is (leave out anything in which you were part of a big team), what your experience specifically working with our stack is, and anything else of interest.

Deep experience with cloud infrastructure (AWS S3/EC2, Azure Blob Storage, etc.) for secure and scalable file storage. Expert-level understanding of data security, encryption, and authentication protocols. Excellent Communicator: You can clearly articulate technical concepts and work collaboratively with our team to define requirements. Problem-Solver: You are proactive, detail-oriented, and focused on delivering a high-quality, functional product. How to Apply: Please begin your proposal with the word "DEALFLOW" to confirm you have read this post in its entirety. Add: Your direct experience with building and optimizing deal rooms or VDRs.

Project Overview We are building a voice-enabled knowledge assistant. A user should be able to call a phone number, ask a question, and get an instant spoken answer from our RAG backend (Azure AI Search \+ Azure OpenAI GPT). The MVP must be delivered fast (within 1 week) and only needs to demonstrate the core loop. After that, we’ll expand to enterprise features. Phase 1 – MVP (Immediate, 5–7 days) • Provision phone number via Azure Communication Services (ACS). • Accept inbound call and stream caller’s audio to Azure Speech STT. • Forward transcript to our existing RAG API (we will provide endpoint). • Take AI response and convert to voice with Azure Speech TTS (or ElevenLabs if easier). • Play audio back to the caller in real time. Goal: • First spoken response within \~2 seconds. • No advanced features (no barge-in, no error handling, no compliance). • Just a working demo I can dial in and test. Phase 2 – Enhancements (2–3 weeks, after MVP) • Barge-in support: caller can interrupt bot mid-sentence. • Latency tuning: prefetch RAG on partial STT, streaming responses. • Error handling & retries: TTS/LLM timeouts, fallback phrases. • Observability: logs, latency metrics, transcripts stored in Blob/App Insights. • Security: Azure Key Vault, private endpoints, tenant-level isolation. • Compliance features: call recording with consent, PII redaction. • Human handoff: escalate call to Microsoft Teams queue when needed. Requirements • Hands-on with Azure Communication Services (ACS) – Call Automation & Media Streaming. • Strong knowledge of Azure Speech Services (STT \+ TTS). • Experience with real-time streaming apps (WebSocket, gRPC, SIP). • Comfortable in Node.js, C\#, or Python. • Familiar with RAG pipelines (Azure AI Search \+ OpenAI) is a plus. • Ability to deliver fast MVP, then improve iteratively. Deliverables Phase 1 (MVP): • Deployed service that connects ACS \-STT \- RAG API \- TTS \- ACS. • Working demo phone number I can dial to test end-to-end. • Short documentation on setup & deployment. Phase 2 (Enhancements): • Feature upgrades as listed above. • Optimized latency & naturalness (target: ≤2s first response, barge-in smaller than 200ms). • Production-ready version with logs, monitoring, and security. Timeline • Phase 1 MVP: deliver within 5–7 days. • Phase 2: 2–3 weeks after MVP approval.

What you’ll do Build a real-time pipeline: stream audio/text → speech-to-text → quick checks → send nudges back to the agent (target: fast feedback on short phrases). Add smart redaction in transcripts (and optional audio bleeping) for card numbers, addresses, etc. Create an agent UI in Next.js: live transcript, gentle prompts (“please read the disclosure”), and a simple checklist. Build a Django backend (API \+ WebSockets) for sessions, policies, audit logs; Celery for post-call processing. Add a basic Admin page to edit rules (patterns \+ prompts), choose actions (nudge vs. mask), and view event logs. Integrate with one voice source for MVP (e.g., Twilio or WebRTC). Must-have experience Next.js/React (TypeScript) for real-time UIs (WebSockets, toasts, state). Django/DRF (Python) with WebSockets (Channels or similar), Celery, Postgres/Redis. AI/NLP \+ Speech-to-Text (e.g., Deepgram/AssemblyAI/GCP/Whisper) and simple rule+ML checks for sensitive data. Comfort with low-latency, streaming systems and secure data handling. Nice to have Twilio/Amazon Connect/Genesys/Five9 or WebRTC experience. Familiarity with PCI/HIPAA basics (we’ll keep scope simple for MVP). Observability/metrics (basic dashboards \+ logs). Deliverables (MVP) End-to-end demo: live transcript, agent nudges, and redaction working. Admin page for policies/rules and action thresholds. Post-call artifacts: summary \+ redacted transcript (and optional redacted audio). Basic analytics: count of events, false-positive review list. Tests \+ dockerized deployment notes.

Seeking a developer to create a technology solution that integrates NetDocuments with Litera Compare to automate our document saving, updating, and redlining process. Our current workflow involves manually receiving updated drafts from opposing counsel, saving them into NetDocuments, pulling our internal version, running a comparison in Litera, and saving the redline back into the system. This is repetitive and time-consuming. We’re looking for a streamlined solution that reduces manual steps and integrates these tools into one seamless process. Ideally the software should: 1\. Ingest new drafts received from opposing counsel (ideally via email intake or drag-and-drop upload). 2\. Automatically save the incoming draft into the correct matter folder in NetDocuments. 3\. Pull the most recent internal version of the same document from NetDocuments. 4\. Run a comparison/redline between the two versions using Litera Compare. 5\. Save both the new draft and the redline output back into NetDocuments as the latest version(s).

I'm looking for an experienced developer to help build a directory website that incorporates community features utilizing Next.js and Cursor AI. There would be a focus on SEO. The database would be via Supabase but nothing is set in stone yet. I'm not a coder and building it with the help of AI (Cursor and gpt5 currently). But I'm capped on both time and knowledge for this project. Ideally, I'd have someone help me with both guidance and taking over certain parts on their own. I can be flexible to some degree in terms of how much is the guidance vs you just build out things. It could be a great challenge/project to do it this way for you, I'm quite technical and learn quickly. Max 10 hours of your time per week. I've outlined the documents detailing the project (Product requiriements, SRS, UI design) they can still be changed but could give you a good idea about it. Happy to send them via DM.
