## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Q1: What makes Payload CMS better than WordPress or other CMS options?**
**A:** Payload CMS is built specifically for modern web development with React/Next.js. Unlike WordPress, it's API-first, TypeScript native, and doesn't suffer from plugin bloat. It offers better performance, security, and developer experience while providing an intuitive interface for content managers. You get the flexibility of a headless CMS with the ease of use of traditional systems.

### **Q2: Do you provide ongoing support after the project is completed?**
**A:** Yes! All packages include initial post-launch support (7 days for Enterprise tier). I also offer ongoing maintenance packages for bug fixes, security updates, and feature enhancements. Many clients choose to continue working with me for long-term development needs, and I prioritize existing clients for additional projects.

### **Q3: Can you work with my existing design or do I need to use your designs?**
**A:** I can work with your existing designs, Figma files, or design mockups. If you don't have designs, I can create clean, modern layouts as part of the Standard and Advanced packages. I always ensure the final implementation is responsive, accessible, and optimized for performance regardless of the design source.

### **Q4: How do you handle revisions and what if I need changes during development?**
**A:** Each package includes a specific number of revision rounds. Minor adjustments within scope are handled smoothly throughout development. For significant changes or additions beyond the original requirements, I provide transparent pricing for additional work. Clear communication and regular check-ins help minimize surprises and ensure you're happy with the direction.

### **Q5: What happens if my project needs are more complex than the standard packages?**
**A:** I offer custom project pricing for unique requirements that don't fit standard packages. This might include complex integrations, custom API development, or specialized functionality. I'll provide a detailed proposal with timeline and pricing. Many complex projects start with a consultation to properly scope the work and ensure the best approach for your specific needs.
