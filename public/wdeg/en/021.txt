In the strength of His Holy Spirit, we are boldly encouraged to:

“Put off your old self, which is being corrupted by evil desires; to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.” (Ephesians 4:22-24)

Get a reliable Bible, one you can read and understand easily—whether that’s a study Bible, a simpler translation, or one with devotionals to help guide your journey. Don’t just let it sit on the shelf; open it daily, even if only for a few minutes. Let God’s Word become your foundation, your anchor, and your compass. It will teach you the truth, strengthen your spirit, and remind you exactly who you are in Christ when the world tries to make you forget.

Find fellowship with a healthy group of believers who love Jesus and are serious about living for Him. You weren’t meant to walk this journey alone. There is power in community, encouragement in shared faith, and healing in honest relationships. Look for a church that teaches the Word faithfully, loves well, and calls you higher. You’ll need people who will pray with you, challenge you, laugh with you, and help you grow when the road gets tough. Brothers and sisters who will become like a new family and support you on this journey.

Above all, seek the Lord with all your heart—not just in the good moments but in the struggles, doubts, and everyday decisions. He is not far off; He is near, and He delights in walking with those who call on His name. The truths and promises in Scripture apply to all His children—including you. Don’t let shame or insecurity lie to you about your worth. God has a purpose and a plan for your life that no one else can fulfill—a calling that not even the devil himself can take away (see Romans 8:28-39).

The Lord longs to dwell with you—not just to save you, but to know you deeply, walk beside you daily and transform your life from the inside out. He’s not waiting for perfection; He meets you exactly where you are and calls you His beloved. Let Him lead. Let Him heal. Let Him show you what real love is—a love that never fades, never fails, and never lets go. Rejoice with exceeding joy: you’ve made the best decision of your life, and all of Heaven rejoices with you.

I look forward to meeting you in eternity—welcome to the family.
