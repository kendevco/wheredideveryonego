This Jewish wedding tradition directly symbolizes the relationship between Jesus and His Church. A covenant was established when Jesus proclaimed at the first Lord’s Supper: “This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of Me.” (1 Corinthians 11:25) There was a purchase price: “You were bought with a price. Therefore, honor God with your body.” (1 Corinthians 6:20)

The Bride of Christ is set apart, not for comfort, but for readiness when He calls:

“Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her, to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to Himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.” (Ephesians 5:25; also see 1 Corinthians 1:2, 6:11; Hebrews 10:10, 13:12)

Then the Bridegroom departed for His Father’s house: “After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was taken up into heaven and sat at God’s right hand.” (Mark 16:19)

We now await the Bridegroom’s return to take His bride to the wedding feast. Note that the Church is expressly protected from God’s wrath (see 1 Thessalonians 5:9, Revelation 3:10). We also recognize several things clearly: signs of imminent judgment are all around us, and signs of imminent Rapture are evident everywhere. Let us consider the “doctrine of imminence.” Imminence literally means “the next expectation.” In other words, nothing else must occur before this event. The Apostle Paul included himself among those awaiting Christ’s imminent return when he wrote: “We who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.” (1 Thessalonians 4:17)

Since the beginning of Christianity, believers have eagerly awaited this event. Believers are taught to expect the Savior from heaven at any moment:

“Therefore our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ.” (Philippians 3:20)

“Just as man was destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and He will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for Him.” (Hebrews 9:27-28)
