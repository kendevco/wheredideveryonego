What Happens During the Tribulation?

As the seals begin to open, we are introduced to the Antichrist, who comes promising peace but ultimately brings worldwide war. The second seal ushers in widespread warfare; the third seal leads to economic chaos; the fourth brings further death by sword, famine, and plague. The fifth seal suggests mass martyrdom of the saints—those who put their faith in Christ after the Rapture. The sixth seal triggers a global Earthquake, and the sun turns dark while the moon becomes like blood.

Finally, the seventh seal introduces the seven trumpets. This is when things become truly devastating. Fire falls from the heavens. Waters turn bitter. Darkness spreads. The Earth trembles under judgment, and humanity is gripped by terror. Each trumpet blast serves as both a warning and a consequence, yet even in the midst of chaos, many still refuse to repent. The long-withheld wrath of God is unleashed on an unrepentant world.

The first trumpet unleashes hail and fire mixed with blood, burning up a third of the Earth, likely caused by a giant meteor strike. The second trumpet reveals something like a huge mountain ablaze, thrown into the sea, destroying a third of the oceans and marine life (see Revelation 8:6). Trumpet three delivers a meteor named Wormwood, poisoning fresh waters. At the fourth trumpet, the Archangel Michael strikes, and a third of the heavens turn dark. At the fifth trumpet, demonic locusts are released from the abyss. These creatures are led by “Apollyon,” derived from Apollo. They torment humanity with scorpion-like stings lasting five months. The sixth trumpet releases four mighty angels who kill a third of mankind through fire, smoke, and sulfur (see Revelation 9:13-19).

Finally, the seventh trumpet announces God’s supreme reign upon His throne, even amidst the world’s chaos.

“I saw another great and marvelous sign in heaven: seven angels with the seven last plagues—last because with them God’s wrath is completed.” (Revelation 15:1)
