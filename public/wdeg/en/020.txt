Come to Jesus and Receive New Life

If you recognize your need for God’s mercy and long to spend eternity with Him, offer this prayer with a heart of faith, trusting in the strength and grace He freely gives:

Dear God in Heaven,
I am a sinner, separated from You because of my sin. Have mercy on me, for I believe Your love is better than life. I believe You died for all my sins—past, present, and future. Because You love me with an eternal love, I ask You to forgive all my sins. I desire to turn away from sin and fall into Your loving arms. Please accept me into Heaven and make me worthy through the blood of Your Son, Jesus Christ, my Savior. Because You first loved me, I love You. I receive Your love right now. Fill me with Your Holy Spirit so I may have the wisdom and courage to face the rest of my life. Through this small amount of faith, I believe You have given me the right to become a child of God. Thank You, Father. I will follow You as Your dear child, now and forever!

If you prayed sincerely to receive Jesus as your Savior, the Bible confidently declares you are now a new creation—no longer bound in sin, no longer separated from God.

Coming to Christ isn’t the end of the journey—it’s the beginning of a new life:

“If anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: the old has gone, the new is here!” (2 Corinthians 5:17)

When we accept His gift of salvation, we aren’t just forgiven; we are made new from the inside out. Our identity shifts, our purpose deepens, and the Spirit of God begins a transforming work in us. We’re no longer defined by our past, our pain, or our failures—we are now citizens of Heaven, children of the Most High. But with this new life comes a call to live differently, to grow, and to let go of the things that once held us captive.
