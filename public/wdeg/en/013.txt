We’re reminded of the rich fool who said to himself:

“‘You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink, and be merry.’ But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night, your life will be demanded of you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?’ This is how it will be with anyone who stores up things for himself but is not rich toward God.” (Luke 12:19-21)

Many come to Christ believing they’ve acquired spiritual “fire insurance.” They may claim His name but live as if He’s distant or optional—giving Him their Sundays but not their hearts. They go through the motions without true surrender, mistaking routine for relationship. But Jesus desires a Bride who loves Him with all her heart, soul, mind, and strength. To the lukewarm church in Laodicea, Jesus gave this warning:

“I know your deeds, that you are neither hot or cold. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot or cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth. You say, ‘I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.’ But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked.” (Revelation 3:16-17)

It is, therefore, crucial that we consistently examine our faith to ensure we remain in true communion with our Savior:

“Work out your faith with fear and trembling.” (Philippians 2:12)

The Lord paid the highest price for our salvation; we must not treat it lightly. When Jesus returns for His people, He seeks a pure and holy Church longing for His presence—not a half-hearted bride ashamed of Him or seeking worldly pleasures over purity. He’s not coming back for a distracted Church but for one dressed in readiness, with lamps full and hearts burning for Him. This is not a time to play games with grace or assume we have more time. The call is urgent. The Groom is near. Let us be found watching, waiting, and wholly surrendered when He comes. Those who truly love Him will not be caught off guard—they will be the ones wide awake in the midnight hour.

As confusion, deception, and global unrest continue to rise, it’s worth remembering that even Jesus’ disciples were desperate to understand the signs of the end—what to watch for and when He would return in power and glory. They weren’t looking for vague comfort—they wanted real answers, and Jesus didn’t leave them in the dark:
