laughing. He kept hammering. The ark was God’s provision, and when Noah entered, the Lord Himself shut the door. Jesus said, “I am the door.” (John 10:9) One door then. One door now.

Not much has changed. The skies will break open again. Today, many still scoff at the return of Christ. They call it a myth. Panic. Delusion. But the flood came—and so will the Son of Man. The ark was real. The judgment of the wicked in the roaring waves was real. And the return of Jesus is real, too. This wait is a pause for repentance before the storm breaks again:

“Above all, you must understand that in the last days, scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. They will say, ‘Where is this coming he promised? Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.’ By these waters … the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. By the same word, the present heavens and Earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the Day of Judgment and destruction of the ungodly. The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, as some of you understand slowness. Instead, He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish but for everyone to come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the Earth and everything in it will be laid bare.” (1 Peter 3:3-4, 6-7, 9-10)

(Romans 1:18-32)

We see that God does not take kindly to our sinful nature. But in Christ, God forgives our sin, even sparing the faithful from the Tribulation to come: “For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Thessalonians 5:9)
