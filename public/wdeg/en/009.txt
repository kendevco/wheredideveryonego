It’s All About the Wedding!

There is just something special about weddings. Nearly everyone loves being invited to a one and being part of the joyous and solemn occasion celebrating the joining of husband and wife in the presence of God. Every wedding has a distinct theme, with carefully coordinated colors woven into the flowers, napkins, and even the cake. Guests arrive—family and friends all gathered together. At some point, everyone is seated and then stands again as the bride makes her grand entrance. There are smiles and occasional tears of joy as she marches down the aisle. Of course, there’s that look from the groom as he sees her adorned beautifully—hair perfect, nails manicured, an elegant dress flowing behind her. Some catch the gleam in his eye as he sees her like this for the first time, realizing that at this moment, a lifetime of memories is just beginning. Then come the pictures of the perfect day with their closest loved ones and friends. Soon, there is feasting, dancing, music, and don’t forget the sentimental toast! Finally, the honeymoon send-off and consummation.

The wedding imagery is the most prominent of all the analogies the Bible gives us concerning the Rapture. God symbolizes the union of Himself and His chosen people, analogous to the marriage of a groom and his bride. That is why the Church is referred to as the Bride of Christ (see John 3:29, Ephesians 5:22-23, Romans 7:4, 2 Corinthians 11:2, James 4:4). In biblical times, Jewish weddings were beloved but involved a much more elaborate process than weddings today. First came the betrothal, or ketuvah, where a solemn pledge of commitment to marry was made. Part of the betrothal was paying the purchase price given to the bride’s family. This betrothal was a binding contract, equivalent to marriage, but without living together or consummation.

Next, the bridegroom would depart for his father’s house, where he would build an addition called the bridal chamber. He was expected to prepare thoroughly to care for his wife in married life. His return for her was imminent—anticipated at any moment—but preparations might take a year or more. Meanwhile, the betrothed bride set herself apart, learning homemaking skills and preparing for their new life together. She focused her hope and devotion solely on her husband-to-be, remaining pure and faithful. Thus, both parties eagerly prepared for each other in loving anticipation.

Finally, there would be a surprise gathering when the bridegroom, with his attendants, would arrive—usually at night—to take his bride away to the wedding ceremony. The newlyweds would enter the marriage chamber, and the groom would later announce the consummation. Then, a seven-day wedding feast would follow, concluding with the bride’s unveiling. At a wedding feast like this, Jesus performed His first miracle, turning water into wine, due to the host’s embarrassment at running out during such a glorious occasion (see John 2).
