The first bowl of wrath inflicts painful sores upon those who accepted the Mark of the Beast. The second bowl turns the seas into blood, killing all sea life. The third bowl transforms all fresh water into blood. The fourth causes the sun to scorch multitudes. The fifth plunges the kingdom of the Beast into deep darkness. The sixth dries up the Euphrates, enabling the kings from the East to gather against Israel at Armageddon. With the seventh bowl, a loud voice from God’s throne declares, “It is done!” A catastrophic Earthquake shakes the globe.

While these judgments devastate humanity, other frightening events unfold with relentless cadence. As the Antichrist consolidates his power, only those marked by the Beast may buy or sell. Everyone else? Shut out of the system (see Revelation 13). Tragically, everyone who willingly receives this mark seals their eternal fate, damned to hell forever.

Two witnesses will preach boldly against the Antichrist, supernaturally protected by God. However, halfway through the tribulation, they are killed, and after three-and-a-half days, they miraculously rise from the dead and ascend to heaven (Revelation 11). Near the tribulation’s end, Babylon—the great commercial hub of the world—is destroyed (Revelation 18).

Finally, the world’s armies gather against Christ at the Battle of Armageddon, where they are utterly destroyed (Revelation 19:11-21). Jesus casts the Beast and the False Prophet into the lake of burning sulfur. Satan—the ancient serpent or the dragon—is bound and thrown into the Abyss for a thousand years.

Today, the Antichrist is fully prepared to step onto the world stage. Discussions of peace treaties are significant because the tribulation officially begins when a seven-year peace treaty is confirmed (Daniel 9:27). Talks about rebuilding the Jewish Third Temple are also underway, fulfilling necessary prophecy.

The groundwork for a one-world digital currency is already being established. Advances in technology—such as microchips implanted in the hand or forehead—enable unprecedented identification and tracking. Meanwhile, the prophetic alliance of Russia, Syria, and Iran foretold in Ezekiel 38-39 is firmly in place. Could the world be any closer to the brink of apocalypse?
