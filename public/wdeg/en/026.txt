The Lord’s Prayer
Our Father, who art in heaven,
Hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,
On Earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
And forgive us our trespasses,
As we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil.
For Thine is the kingdom,
And the power, and the glory,
Forever and ever. Amen.

God has chosen and loved you, not based on your perfection but on His unshakable grace. Remembering that new reality—even when we wander—is often the hardest and most important fight of faith. The enemy will try to shame you, accuse you, and drag you back into fear. Don’t let him. Stand firm in the truth that you belong to Christ.
