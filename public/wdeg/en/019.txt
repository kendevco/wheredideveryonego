He is knocking at your door to save you, not to condemn you. He sees the weight you carry, the pain you hide, and the questions you’re afraid to ask. He’s not looking for perfection; He’s looking for surrender. The door only opens from the inside, and He will not force His way in. Don’t let the noise of this life drown out the most important invitation you will ever receive. The time to come home is now.

Whatever you’ve done, however far away you feel—you are not beyond His reach. Jesus died with your name on His heart and rose to offer you eternal life, not just survival. Every breath you’ve been given is a chance to say yes. Hell is real, but so is grace. And it’s reaching for you even now.

But even now—before the final trumpet sounds, before the wrath of God is poured out in full—you still have time. The door of mercy is still open. Jesus has not returned yet, and that delay is not indifference—it’s grace. The same God who judges sin is the God who sent His Son to bear that judgment in your place. You don’t have to be left behind. You don’t have to face what’s coming. The cross of Christ is the ark of this generation, and the invitation to enter it is extended to you right now. Not because you’re strong. Not because you’re good. But because He is. All of history is racing toward a final moment—but today is still called today. You’re not too late.

And maybe you’re thinking, “I’ve tried before. I always fail. I mess everything up. I’m too weak. Too broken. Too far gone.” But listen: God doesn’t ask you to be strong. He asks you to be honest. You don’t need to clean yourself up first—He already knows your mess. What He wants is your heart, your surrender, your yes.

Jesus didn’t come for the proud or the perfect—He came for sinners. For the foolish, the weak, the rejected. For the ones who’ve messed it up again and again, even when they knew better. Grace isn’t for the worthy—it’s for the desperate. For the tired, the ashamed, the ones who’ve already given up on themselves. And if that’s you, then you are exactly the one He came to rescue. Don’t let the fear of failing again keep you from the One who already took your punishment and rose again to give you life. He came specifically for you, not just for everyone else—He came FOR YOU. Today is the day, open the door and let Him in.
