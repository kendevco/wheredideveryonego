The anticipation that Christ could return at any moment doesn’t lead to panic—it leads to purpose. It awakens a holy urgency in the hearts of His people. We walk in victory, pursue righteousness, and fix our eyes on things above. We don’t live aimlessly, devoid of hope, or drift with the culture. It reminds us that this world is not our home, and that our King is near. His return is not just a future event—it’s a present motivation. It sharpens our faith and purifies our lives. As Scripture says: “Everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.” (1 John 3:3)

The Parable of the Ten Virgins

“At that time, the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. The wise, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep. At midnight, the cry rang out: ‘Here’s the bridegroom! Come out and meet him!’ Then, all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’ ‘No,’ they replied, ‘there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’ But while they were going to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut. Later, the others also came, saying, ‘Sir! Sir! Open the door for us!’ But he replied, ‘I tell you the truth, I don’t know you.’ Therefore, keep watch because you do not know the day or the hour.” (Matthew 25:1-13)

This passage is both exciting and terrifying. It paints a picture of joy for some—and deep sorrow for others. To the faithful believer, it provides powerful assurance that they have a place reserved at the wedding banquet prepared for the Bride of Christ and Jesus, the Bridegroom. It is the fulfillment of a long-anticipated promise, a celebration of their relationship—intimate, sacred, and eternal.

This banquet will be a time of unimaginable rejoicing, where the Bride will finally see Jesus face-to-face, not through faith, but with her own eyes. She will dine and fellowship with the One who gave everything for her, clothed not in her own righteousness but in the radiance He provided. There will be no more pain, no more striving—only joy, worship, and love unfiltered by this broken world. And this celebration won’t be brief or symbolic—it will last seven years in heavenly splendor while judgment unfolds below. While the Earth groans in chaos, the Bride will be safe in the arms of her Bridegroom, honored, cherished, and made ready for the final unveiling.
