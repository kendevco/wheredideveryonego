Even with such a costly gift offered freely, not everyone will receive it. The invitation is open to all, but the path is not popular—and Scripture makes that painfully clear. Sadly, many reject this gift, bringing destruction upon themselves:

“Enter through the narrow gate. Wide is the gate, and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate, and narrow is the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.” (Matthew 7:13-14)

“There is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12)

“Jesus answered, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.’” (John 14:6)

He did everything necessary by dying for you. Won’t you make the right choice today? Time is rapidly running out. Today is the day of salvation—not tomorrow, not someday. Apart from Christ, your future holds nothing worthwhile, for the world and its evil desires are passing away. Anything good, anything that you truly love, it all came from him anyway, and our Savior delights to share His good gifts with those who earnestly love Him.

The birth pains are accelerating, becoming more and more intense with each passing day. The signs shout, will you refuse to listen? It is dangerous to delay, hoping to slip into heaven at the last minute. This is the last minute. And choosing not to decide is still a decision.

Answer the call of your Savior:

“Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and dine with him, and he with Me.” (Revelation 3:20)
