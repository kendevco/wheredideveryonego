Time for Some Good News!

The picture of doom painted here does not have to be your future. God is merciful and fervently desires that none should perish:

“The Lord is not slow to fulfill His promise…but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.” (2 Peter 3:9)

In Christ, God made a way for broken people to be restored, adopted, and brought near as His own beloved children. Knowing we would sin and be separated from Him, He had a redemptive plan even before time began. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to pay the ultimate price for our sins so we might dwell eternally with Him. This was not a backup plan—it was the expression of His love from the very beginning.

Consider what’s commonly called the Romans Road to salvation:

“For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:23)

“But God demonstrates His love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8)

“For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 6:23)

“If you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved… Anyone who trusts in Him will never be put to shame.” (Romans 10:9-11)

“The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.” (Romans 8:16)

God’s message of grace demonstrates His immense love for us, as He desires to spend eternity with us. He created us to glorify and enjoy Him forever, yet our sin separated us from His presence. Christ offered the perfect sacrifice, paying a debt He didn’t owe—one we could never pay.

If we receive this incredible gift and believe in the Son of God, Scripture says we are saved:

“To all who received Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God—children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision, nor a husband’s will, but born of God.” (John 1:12-13)
