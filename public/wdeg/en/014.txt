“Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and the end of the age?” Jesus answered, “See to it that no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars… Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and Earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of the birth pains.” (Matthew 24:3-8)

Birth pains intensify and increase in frequency as the time of birth approaches. This is precisely what’s happening today. Ominous signs on the Earth and in the heavens are multiplying at an alarming rate. Strange weather patterns, flocks of birds mysteriously dropping dead, enormous schools of fish washing ashore worldwide—the foreboding headlines seem endless (see Zephaniah 1:3). Massive Earthquakes, like those in Japan, alter the very rotation of the planet (see Isaiah 24:20). Asteroids frequently pass dangerously close to Earth, bodies of water turn blood red, enormous swarms of locusts ravage the Middle East, and people worldwide rage over political and cultural divisions. The New World Order’s “Great Reset” is already underway, and out of this chaos, they will usher in their counterfeit “Messiah.”

So, you might ask, what exactly are we being rescued from? The answer is sobering. The Book of Revelation lays out in graphic detail the horrors awaiting those left behind after the Rapture. Once the Church is caught up—removed from the Earth at the close of Revelation 3—the scene shifts dramatically. Chapters 4 and 5 provide a glimpse into the throne room of Heaven, revealing that every event on Earth during the Tribulation is first decreed in the heavenly realm. The judgments that follow are not random—they are precise acts of divine justice.

What unfolds next is a devastating cascade of judgment: the breaking of the seven seals unleashes conquest, war, famine, and death. As the seventh seal is opened, it gives way to seven trumpets—each one sounding a new wave of catastrophe, from environmental devastation to demonic torment.

Finally, the seven bowls of God’s wrath are poured out without mixture, bringing about the complete collapse of Earthly systems and the final reckoning of rebellious humanity. Each stage grows more intense, more global, and more undeniable, as the wrath of God is poured out in full upon a world that rejected His mercy.

This is what the Rapture spares the faithful from—not mere hardship, but the most terrifying era of divine judgment the world has ever seen. And the signs suggest it could begin at any moment.
