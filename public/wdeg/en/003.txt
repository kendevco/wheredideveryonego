Videos roll in—two friends walking side by side, and in an instant, one is gone. A nanny cam records a room full of preschoolers napping peacefully until, one by one, their blankets collapse as if an unseen force has plucked them away. The same eerie scenes play on every station, in every language, across every country. And the world asks in unison: “Where did everyone go?” They are met with only silence. Their voices grow louder, more frantic: “WHERE DID EVERYONE GO?!”

The Rapture Is Closer Than You Think

The Bible frequently predicts and emphasizes this event, which Christians call the Rapture. While the Rapture is part of the broader “Second Coming,” it should not be confused with Christ’s final return to establish His kingdom on Earth. The Rapture will occur first, removing believers from the coming wrath—ushering them into the presence of their Savior. It will be sudden, unexpected, and unmistakable. When the trumpet sounds, the dead in Christ will rise, and those who are alive will be caught up together with them in the clouds. This is our hope—the hope of never dying, of being transformed in an instant, and of being rescued from this sin-sick planet before the Great and Terrible Day of the Lord. It is not fear that drives this hope, but love—a longing to be with the One who promised, “I go to prepare a place for you.”

This pamphlet is meant to keep biblical truth front and center amid the growing flood of deception that will only intensify as the end of the age approaches. In a world flooded with false narratives and manipulated images, where the media often distorts more than it reveals, discernment is no longer optional—it is essential. The lines between truth and falsehood are blurring rapidly, even within religious circles. Many will be led astray by smooth words, counterfeit miracles, and doctrines that sound right but are rooted in darkness. The Bible warns of a time when people will no longer tolerate sound teaching but will gather teachers who say what their itching ears want to hear. That time is here. And as confusion deepens, believers must anchor themselves to the unchanging Word of God. This is not a time for casual faith. It is a time to wake up, be alert, and walk in the light.

During the reign of the Antichrist, nothing can be believed, for the rulers of this world will speak in the language of their father, whom Christians call the devil, the father of lies. He will rule for seven years, and the full explanation of his dictatorship and world events is carefully chronicled in the Book of Revelation. It is this period from which we long to be spared. His return for the faithful, also called the Bride of Christ, is very close at hand. So, will you be ready when He comes for His

bride?
